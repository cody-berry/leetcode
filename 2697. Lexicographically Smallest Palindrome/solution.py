    # Given a string, this function returns the lexicographically smallest palindrome made
    # by replacing the letters the least amount of times. a is lexicographically smaller 
    # than b if, in the first place where a and b differ, a's letter appears earlier in
    # the alphabet then the respective letter in b does.

        # These are the two indices that, in the resulting string, we are going to make the same.
        # If the string length is odd, then the first index should start at the floored value
        # and the second index should start at the ceiled value.
        
        # If the string length is even, then the first index should be the string length divided
        # by two minus one, and the last index should be the same except plus instead of minus.
        
        # This is the string resulting from operations.
        
        # While the first index is in range of the string...
        
            # Check the letters in the index of the resulting string.
            
                # If they are different, then check the ascii code of the letters. Note that this is
                # only lowercase English letters, so there will be no confusions.
                
                # Make the letter with the bigger code the one with the smaller code.
        
        # Return the resulting string.
